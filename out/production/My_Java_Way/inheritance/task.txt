1. Refine the class system of the lesson20240924.inheritance package created in the lesson , so that:


the Creature class would be the abstract class at the top of the hierarchy of all the inhabitants of the house

the Creature class would contain the String name field

abstract void introduce() method would be located in Creature

Human and Animal inherited from Creature

the Human class has the ability to walk animals, method walk(Animal animal).
After the walk the animal becomes hungry.

--

Create a play(Creature another) method so that all the inhabitants of the house can play with each other. When they play, a message is displayed about who is playing with whom. Refine the play() method of subclasses so that when cats try to play with dogs:
dog.play(cat) - the dog would bark at the cat
cat.play(dog) - the cat would run away.

--

Using interfaces:

Create a Robot class with the fields name, id, version

Add the ability to walk animals to the Human and Robot classes by adding the walk(Animal animal) method of the Walkable interface.

Add the ability to catch mice to the Cat and Robot classes using the catchMouse() method of the CatchingSkills interface.
