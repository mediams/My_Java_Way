Realize the school model:
Teacher class
Student class
class School with the main() method
a) Create an enumeration Subject with the name of subjects in the school. Each teacher knows only one subject. 
b) Create arrays of subjects in students (with studied subjects). When initialized, they are empty.
c) Realize the logic of methods 


teach(Student student)

teach(Student[] students)
methods of the teacher with these enumerations, so that after teaching() is executed, the corresponding students will have information about the studied subject added.
d) In the Student class, add a method to check 

knows(Subject subject subject).
The method outputs true if the student has studied the given subject and false otherwise.
e) Demonstrate the functionality in the School class
